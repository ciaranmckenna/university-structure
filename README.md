# university-structure

This is a simple program using inheritance hierarchy and an interface to share instance
variables and methods related to objects.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Java installed on your machine. To check, run the following on the command line:

`java --version`

If you do not have Java installed, you should get a prompt to do so. Once installed,
you should also have access to `javac`. You can check this by running;

`javac --version`

### Running UniversityAdmin

Run these commands in your terminal to test the program is working correctly.

```
javac UniversityAdmin.java
java UniversityAdmin
```

This will output to the console, the results of the method calls.
